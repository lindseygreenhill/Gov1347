# Covid-19, Blame, and Incumbency

October 24, 2020

## Introduction

Covid-19 is obviously at the forfront of many voters minds today. As proven in the final presidential [debate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/final-trump-biden-debate-marks-start-of-sprint-to-election-11603386976), a lot of ambiguity still surrounds the question of different vaccines and the potential end of the pandemic. Also discussed in the debate was President Trump's success or failure with handling the virus, depending on your perspective. This question of "did Trump do a good job with Covid?" draws attention to a larger point of interest: do voters blame Trump for the continued pandemic? 

In this blog post I will investigate this question through looking at the relationship of average poll support for Trump and different measures of Covid-19 progression such as death rate and cases per capita. 

### Background: how did Covid-19 affect different states? 

For some brief context of the historical and current state of Covid-19 in each state, see the visual below that shows Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in each state.

> - It is apparent that cases per capita is continuing to grow as we near the election
> - Southern states seem to be hit relatively hard on a per capita basis 
> - Battleground states such as Arizona, Georgia, and Florida seem to have some of the highest case rates for their populations

### Is there a relationship between polls and worsening of Covid-19?
