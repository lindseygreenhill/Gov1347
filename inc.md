# Incumbency, Federal Spending, and Covid-19 Aid

### Introduction

Going back to the idea of retrospective voting explored in my [economy post](Econ.md), 
this weekâ€™s blog post will investigate how voters reward incumbents for allocating federal funds to
their home areas. I will summarise a state level model developed by Douglas Kriner and Andrew Reeves
in 2012 and then discuss how that model can be used to think about the impacts of Covid-19
aid on the 2020 election. 


### Kriner and Reeves Model

In their [2012 paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41495082?seq=1) "The Influence of Federal Spending on Presidential Elections," Kriner and Reeves demonstrate a positive relationship between an increase in 
federal spending at a state level and vote share for an incumbent president. Some of their 
key findings are as follows:

> - On average, for every percent increase in federal spending between years, there is an increase
in popular vote share for the incumbent
> - This relationship is much stronger in competitive states (defined as states where the loser's popular
vote share averaged to be >= 45% in the past three elections) than non-competive states
> - For competitive states their model calculated a .02 increase in popular vote share for every
1% increase in federal spending
> - For non-competitive states, this coefficient was .008
> - In line with this finding, incumbents typically direct more federal spending to swing states during
both election andn non election years

In summary, Kriner and Reeves' work demonstrates that when more money goes to states, thoses states tend to
vote more for the incumbent than they otherwise would have (especially in competitive states). Although 
Covid-19 aid is different than general federal spending, it is not too far of a stretch to apply the principles
of Kriner and Reeve's work to estimate the effect of pandemic spending on the election.
