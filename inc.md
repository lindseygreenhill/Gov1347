# Incumbency, Federal Spending, and Covid-19 Aid

### Introduction

Going back to the idea of retrospective voting explored in my [economy post](Econ.md), 
this weekâ€™s blog post will investigate how voters reward incumbents for allocating federal funds to
their home areas. I will first look at a county level model developed by Kriner and Reaves
in 2012 and then discuss how that model can be used to think about the impacts of Covid-19
aid on the 2020 election.
