# The 2020 Election and the Latino Vote

## Introduction
As 2020 comes to a close, it’s hard not to be excited about what the next year has to offer. Maybe life will return to pre-pandemic standards. Maybe I’ll get to go back to college. And, perhaps more relevantly to this blog, maybe I will be able to have a conversation with my relatives next Thanksgiving about a topic not related to Donald Trump or the election. However, before the new year arrives, I am going to offer one last blog post that is, as per usual, political. Specifically, I am going to explore one of the election’s most talked about media narratives: does the Latino vote actually exist?

## Background

Per the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/31/where-latinos-have-the-most-eligible-voters-in-the-2020-election/), Latinos made up just over 13% of the US eligible voter population in 2020. In 2016, the group accounted for just under 12%. In 2016, Trump won 28% of the Latino vote, and in 2020 he won 32%. In 2016, Clinton won about 66% of the Latino vote, and in 2020 Biden won the same. 

After the election, many media outlets claimed that the Latino vote had a major impact on the election. [Some say](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/04/what-election-results-so-far-tell-us-about-latino-vote/) that the Latino vote is why Biden performed so well in Texas, Arizona, and Virginia. On the other hand, many also claim that the Latino vote is why Biden lost Florida. But how can that be that the Latino vote had such differing effects across states? 

Flashy headlines about this question appeared in publications across the political spectrum with an answer – **there is no unified Latino vote, and maybe there never was.**
